# Credit-Risk-Analysis-Basic-
This is a repo on Credit risk analysis (EDA+ Modelling) using a relevant small Kaggle dataset. It is called "basic" since it is a small dataset, compared to much larger (and I believe still available) versions, which depending on how this goes, I may attempt to work on too.
